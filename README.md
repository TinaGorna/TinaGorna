Hi there! 👋 My name is Kristina.
😊 I'm responsible, motivated, easy-to-learn React Frontend Developer open to work now.
😍 I like programming because it's interesting for me to create something, to make user interface alive and friendly.
🌱 I’m currently learning technologies associated with Frontend.
👯 I will be glad to share my experience and learn from other developers.
🥅 My the 2021 goal is to become a cool React Frontend Developer.
